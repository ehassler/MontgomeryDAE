Construction of full factorial designs is rather trivial, but construction of fractions of two-level designs can be tricky.  The package `FrF2` [@FrF2] has methods to create and visualize both regular fractions (where full confounding occurs between effects) and non-regular fractions (where partial aliasing occurs).  The function `FrF2` is very flexible in how you can request a design.  Below, I have requested a four-factor resolution III design:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(FrF2)

FrF2(nfactors=4, resolution=3)
```
\noindent Next, I request a design on five factors using eight runs:
```{r}
FrF2(nfactors=5, nruns=8)
```



# Example 8.1


We return again to the filtration rate experiment, except this time we'll run it as a $2^{4-1}_{\mathrm{IV}}$ design with `D` aliased with the `A:B:C` interaction (see Table 8.3):
```{r}
model <-lm(FiltrationRate ~ A + B + C + D + A:B + A:C + A:D, data=Table8.3)
print(summary(model))
```

\noindent Since effects A, C, and D are large we remove B and the A:B interaction:

```{r}
model <-lm(FiltrationRate ~ A + C + D + A:C + A:D, data=Table8.3)
print(summary(model))
```

# Example 8.2


An integrated circuit manufacturing process was studied to understand how aperture setting (`A`), exposure time (`B`), develop time (`C`), and mask dimension (`D`) affected yield.  The design used was a $2^{5-1}$ design with `E` aliased to the `A:B:C:D` interaction:
```{r message=FALSE}
model <- aov(Yield ~ . * ., data=Table8.5)
model.ss <- anova(model)[['Sum Sq']]
effect.estimates <- data.frame(
	'EffectEstimate'=2 * coef(model)[-1],
	'SumOfSquares'=model.ss[-1],
	'Contribution'=sprintf('%0.2f%%', 100*model.ss[-1]/sum(model.ss[-1]))
)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(effect.estimates) %>% kable_styling()
```
\noindent The terms `A`, `B`, `C` and `A:B` have large magnitude, but we'll verify that they look like active effects with a half-normal probability plot:
```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE}
library(DoE.base)
vals <- halfnormal(model)
vals$signif
```

\noindent Next, we fit the reduced model:
```{r}
model <- aov(Yield ~ A + B + C + A:B, data=Table8.5)
print(summary(model))
```

\noindent Checking the diagnostic plots, it looks like there's no strong evidence our assumptions have been violated:
```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
op <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
qqnorm(resid(model), main='Normal Probability Plot')
qqline(resid(model), col='orange')
plot(x=predict(model), y=resid(model), main='Fitted vs. Residual')
par(op)
```

## Example 8.4


A common defect that can occur in injection molding is excessive shrinkage.  An investigation into how mold temperature (`A`), screw speed (`B`), holding time (`C`), cycle time (`D`), gate size (`E`), and holding pressure (`F`) affect shrinkage so that shrinkage can be better controlled.  A $2^{6-2}_\mathrm{IV}$ design was used with `E` aliased to `ABC` and `F` aliased to `B:C:D`:
```{r}
model <- lm(Shrinkage ~ . * ., data=Table8.10)
print(summary(model))
```
\noindent The only main effects that are active are `A` and `B`.  The `A:B` interaction is large, but it is aliased with `C:E`.  Since neither `C` nor `E` is active we'll assume it's the `A:B` interaction that's active.  Compare this to a half-normal probability plot:
```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
halfnormal(model)
```

\noindent Because of this we decide to keep `A`, `B`, and the `A:B` interaction:

```{r}
model <- lm(Shrinkage ~ A + B + A:B, data=Table8.10)
print(summary(model))
```

\noindent Next, let's check the normal probability plot and the residual versus holding time:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
op <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
qqnorm(resid(model), main='Normal Probability Plot')
qqline(resid(model), col='orange')
plot(x=Table8.10$C, y=resid(model), main='C vs. Residual')
par(op)
```

\noindent It looks like the variance is much larger at the longer holding time (`C`) than at the smaller holding time.  Next, we model the dispersion:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
ix <- Table8.10$C == 1
X <- model.matrix(Shrinkage ~ -1 + . * ., data=Table8.10)
Fi.star <- apply(
	X,
	2,
	function(w){
		log(
			sd(resid(model)[w == 1])^2 
			/ 
			sd(resid(model)[w != 1])^2
		)
	}
)
vals <- halfnormal(Fi.star)
vals
```

\noindent The plot suggests that we can model dispersion using only `C`.

# Example 8.6

A set of eight factors were selected to model the deviation from profile of the output of a CNC machine. The factors are:

 * `A` - $x$-Axis shift
 * `B` - $y$-Axis shift
 * `C` - $z$-Axis shift
 * `D` - Tool supplier
 * `E` - $a$-Axis shift
 * `F` - Spindle speed
 * `G` - Fixture height
 * `H` - Feed rate

In addition, we are to block on spindle, so we choose to use the `E:H` interaction and the `A:B:E` interaction chain to represent the four blocks.  Our analysis of the $2^{8-3}_\mathrm{IV}$ design in Table 8.16 proceeds as follows:  

```{r}
model <- aov(log(Deviation) ~ Error(Block) + (A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H)^3, data=Table8.16)
print(summary(model))
```

```{r}
model.ss <- summary(model$Within)[[1]][['Sum Sq']]
coef.est <- coef(model$Within)
effect.estimates <- data.frame(
	'EffectEstimate'=2 * coef.est,
	'SumOfSquares'=model.ss,
	'Contribution'=sprintf('%0.2f%%', 100*model.ss/sum(model.ss))
)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(effect.estimates) %>% kable_styling()
```



Process knowledge helps us to decide `A`, `B`, `D`, and `A:D` should be included in the analysis. The `halfnormal` plot does not like `aov` models with error terms, so let's remodel it and just be mindful of what factors represent blocks:
```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
model <- aov(log(Deviation) ~ (A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H)^3, data=Table8.16)
vals <- halfnormal(model)
vals$signif
```

\noindent The plot seems to confirm that `A`, `B`, `D`, and `A:D` are probably active.  We confirm this with the following ANOVA table:  

```{r}
model <- aov(log(Deviation) ~ Error(Block) + A + B + D + A:D, data=Table8.16)
print(summary(model))
```

# Example 8.7


An experiment to understand how eye focus time is affected by acuity or sharpness of vision (`A`), distance from target to eye (`B`), target shape (`C`), illumination level (`D`), target size (`E`), target density (`F`), and subject (`G`) is in Table 8.21. The design is a $2^{7-4}_\mathrm{III}$ fractional factorial.  First, let's select the candidate active main effects:

```{r}
model <- lm(Time ~ ., data=Table8.21)
print(2*coef(model)[-1])
```

\noindent As described in the text, when we project down to just `A`, `B`, and `D` we don't get a full factorial in those main effects, but instead we get a replicated $2^{3-1}$.  To disentangle the aliases we need to do a foldover as described in Table 8.22:

```{r}
df <- rbind(Table8.21, Table8.22)
model <- lm(Time ~ (A + B + D)^2, data=df)
summary(model)
```

# Example 8.8

Example 8.8 uses a non-regular fraction called a Plackett-Burman design.  These designs have partial aliasing, and we can fit them with model selection procedures such as stepwise regression.

The text analyzes this with stepwise regression based on $p$-values requiring a $p$-value less than 0.1 to enter and a $p$-value greater than 0.25 to leave.  R's `MASS` package provides stepwise selection based on AIC-like criteria, but does not support $p$-values directly.  While some other R packages do support $p$-value based stepwise regression they fail to support strong or weak heredity as found in JMP and in `stepAIC` in `MASS`.  

For convenience, this package has included `p.stepwise` which does stepwise regression under strong heredity assumptions, e.g. `X1:X2` can only enter the model if `X1` and `X2` are in the model, and `X1` can only leave the model if no interaction involving it is in the model.  The results of this model fitting procedure are given below:

```{r}
alpha.to.enter <- 0.10
alpha.to.leave <- 0.10
model <- lm(y~1, data=Table8.25)
scope <- y ~ (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 + X6 + X7 + X8 + X9 + X10 + X11 + X12)^2

final.model <- p.stepwise(model, scope, alpha.to.enter, alpha.to.leave)
summary(final.model)
```

# Section 8.7.2

Section 8.7.2. analyzes an experiment where six factors were analyzed to determine their effect on the thickness of a coating on  wafer.  The factors were as follows:

 * Spin speed (`A`)
 * Acceleration (`B`)
 * Volume of resist applied (`C`)
 * Spin time (`D`)
 * Resist viscosity (`E`)
 * Exhaust rate (`F`)
 
\noindent We begin with the half-normal probability plot for the data in Table 8.31:
```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, message=FALSE}
model <- lm(Thickness ~ . * ., data=Table8.31)
vals <- halfnormal(model)
vals$signif
```
\noindent This suggests that either `A:B` or `C:E` is large because the two are aliased in our original design.  To address this we do a complete fold-over on `A`, as given in Table 8.32:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, message=FALSE}
model <- lm(Thickness ~ Blocks + (A + B + C + D + E + F)^2, data=Table8.32)
vals <- halfnormal(model)
vals$signif
```

Another option would have been to do a partial fold-over selecting the runs where `A` is at its low level.  This design is given in Table 8.33, but is the same as Table 8.32 where block 2 has `A` at the low level:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, message=FALSE}
ix <- Table8.32[,'Blocks'] == 1 | (Table8.32[,'Blocks'] == 2 & Table8.32[,'A'] == -1)
Table8.33 <- Table8.32[ix,]
model <- lm(Thickness ~ Blocks + (A + B + C + D + E + F)^2, data=Table8.33)
vals <- halfnormal(model, ME.partial=TRUE)
vals$signif
```

\noindent Note that `A:B` is now in the model, as is a term for the second block.  We may ignore this second term as it was necessary to include Block as a main effect to use the `halfnormal` function.

```{r}
model <- aov(Thickness ~ Error(Blocks) + (A + B + C + D + E + F)^2, data=Table8.33)
print(summary(model))
```

\noindent Though the half-normal result differs from the text, the ANOVA table supports our decision to include `A:B` in the model.
