# R Package for Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments 10th Ed.

This repository is for Wiley's companion R package to Douglas C. Montgomery's "Design and Analysis of Experiments" 10th edition.  The [most current version of the PDF Guide](https://github.com/ehassler/MontgomeryDAE/releases/download/10.1/guide.pdf) will walk you through how to use R to work examples and exercises in the text.  

The PDF guide also shows how to install the [most current package](https://github.com/ehassler/MontgomeryDAE/releases/download/10.1/MontgomeryDAE_10.1.tar.gz).  The package contains the content of the PDF in vignettes and also all of the data sets used in the book.  It makes doing the exercises _much_ easier.  

One of the great features of github is that you can report bugs through the "Issues" tab.  Please look there to see if any error you find has been reported, and if it has not then post a report of the error there.
