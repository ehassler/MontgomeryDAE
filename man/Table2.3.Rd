Table 2.3: Normalized Fluorescence After Two Hours
}
\description{
An article in Nature Biotechnology ("Fluorescent Peptides Highlight Peripheral Nerves During Surgery in Mice,‚Äù Vol. 29, 2011) describes the use of a fluorescently labeled peptide that binds to nerves to assist in identification. This \code{"data.frame"} shows the normalized fluorescence after two hours for nerve and muscle tissue for 12 mice.
